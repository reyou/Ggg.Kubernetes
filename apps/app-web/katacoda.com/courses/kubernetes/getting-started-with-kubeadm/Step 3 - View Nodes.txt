Step 3 - View Nodes
The cluster has now been initialised. The Master node will manage the cluster, while our one worker node will run our container workloads.

Task
The Kubernetes CLI, known as kubectl, can now use the configuration to access the cluster. For example, the command below will return the two nodes in our cluster.

kubectl get nodes

At this point, the Nodes will not be ready.

This is because the Container Network Interface has not been deployed. This will be fixed within the next step.
