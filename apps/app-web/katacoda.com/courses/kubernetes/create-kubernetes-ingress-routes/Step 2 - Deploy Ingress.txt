The YAML file ingress.yaml defines a Nginx-based Ingress controller together 
with a service making it available on Port 80 to external connections 
using ExternalIPs. 

If the Kubernetes cluster was running on a cloud provider then it would use a 
LoadBalancer service type.

The ServiceAccount defines the account with a set of permissions on how to access the 
cluster to access the defined Ingress Rules. 

The default server secret is a self-signed certificate for other Nginx example SSL 
connections and is required by the Nginx Default Example.

```
$ cat ingress.yaml
```

Task
The Ingress controllers are deployed in a familiar fashion to other Kubernetes objects with 

```
$ kubectl create -f ingress.yaml

namespace/nginx-ingress created
secret/default-server-secret created
serviceaccount/nginx-ingress created
configmap/nginx-config created
deployment.extensions/nginx-ingress created
service/nginx-ingress created
```

The status can be identified using 

```
$ kubectl get deployment -n nginx-ingress

NAME            DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-ingress   1         1         1            1           52s
```
