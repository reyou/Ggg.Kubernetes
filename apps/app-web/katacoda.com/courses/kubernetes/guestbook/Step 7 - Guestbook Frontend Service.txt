Step 7 - Guestbook Frontend Service
To make the frontend accessible we need to start a service to configure the proxy.

Start Proxy
The YAML defines the service as a NodePort. NodePort allows you to set well-known ports that are shared across your entire cluster. This is like -p 80:80 in Docker.

In this case, we define our web app is running on port 80 but we'll expose the service on 30080.

kubectl create -f frontend-service.yaml

kubectl get services

We'll discuss NodePort in future scenarios.
