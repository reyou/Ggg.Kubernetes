Step 4 - Replication Slave Pods
In this example we'll be running Redis Slaves which will have replicated data from the master. More details of Redis replication can be found at http://redis.io/topics/replication

As previously described, the controller defines how the service runs. In this example we need to determine how the service discovers the other pods. The YAML represents the GET_HOSTS_FROM property as DNS. You can change it to use Environment variables in the yaml but this introduces creation-order dependencies as the service needs to be running for the environment variable to be defined.

Start Redis Slave Controller
In this case, we'll be launching two instances of the pod using the image kubernetes/redis-slave:v2. It will link to redis-master via DNS.

kubectl create -f redis-slave-controller.yaml

List Replication Controllers
kubectl get rc
