Step 8 - Access Guestbook Frontend
With all controllers and services defined Kubernetes will start launching them as Pods. A pod can have different states depending on what's happening. For example, if the Docker Image is still being downloaded then the Pod will have a pending state as it's not able to launch. Once ready the status will change to running.

View Pods Status
You can view the status using the following command:

kubectl get pods

Find NodePort
If you didn't assign a well-known NodePort then Kubernetes will assign an available port randomly. You can find the assigned NodePort using kubectl.

kubectl describe service frontend | grep NodePort

View UI
Once the Pod is in running state you will be able to view the UI via port 30080. Use the URL to view the page https://2886795333-30080-ollie02.environments.katacoda.com
