Step 6 - Frontend Replicated Pods
With the data services started we can now deploy the web application. The pattern of deploying a web application is the same as the pods we've deployed before.

Launch Frontend
The YAML defines a service called frontend that uses the image _gcr.io/googlesamples/gb-frontend:v3. The replication controller will ensure that three pods will always exist.

kubectl create -f frontend-controller.yaml

List controllers and pods
kubectl get rc

kubectl get pods

PHP Code
The PHP code uses HTTP and JSON to communicate with Redis. When setting a value requests go to redis-master while read data comes from the redis-slave nodes.
