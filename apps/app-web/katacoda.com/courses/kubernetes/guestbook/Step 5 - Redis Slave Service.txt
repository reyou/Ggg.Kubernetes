Step 5 - Redis Slave Service
As before we need to make our slaves accessible to incoming requests. This is done by starting a service which knows how to communicate with redis-slave.

Because we have two replicated pods the service will also provide load balancing between the two nodes.

Start Redis Slave Service
kubectl create -f redis-slave-service.yaml

kubectl get services
