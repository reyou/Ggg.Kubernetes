Step 1 - Start Kubernetes
To start we need a running Kubernetes cluster. The details of this are explained in the Launch Kubernetes cluster scenario.

Task
Start a single-node cluster using the helper script. The helper script will launch the API, Master, a Proxy and DNS discovery. The Web App uses DNS Discovery to find the Redis slave to store data.

launch.sh

Health Check
Check everything is up using the following health Check: kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes

If the node returns NotReady then it is still waiting. Wait a couple of seconds before retrying.
