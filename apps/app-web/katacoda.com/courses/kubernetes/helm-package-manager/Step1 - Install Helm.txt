Helm is a single binary that manages deploying Charts to Kubernetes. 
A chart is a packaged unit of kubernetes software. 
It can be downloaded from https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases

```
$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.8.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf helm-v2.8.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/
```

Once installed, initialise update the local cache to sync the latest available packages with the environment.

```
$ helm init
