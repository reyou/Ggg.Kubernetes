Step 1 - Start Minikube
Minikube has been installed and configured in the environment. Check that it is properly installed, by running the minikube version command:

minikube version

Start the cluster, by running the minikube start command:

minikube start

Great! You now have a running Kubernetes cluster in your online terminal. Minikube started a virtual machine for you, and a Kubernetes cluster is now running in that VM.
