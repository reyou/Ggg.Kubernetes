Step 5 - Scale Containers
With our deployment running we can now use kubectl to scale the number of replicas.

Scaling the deployment will request Kubernetes to launch additional Pods. These Pods will then automatically be load balanced using the exposed Service.

Task
The command kubectl scale allows us to adjust the number of Pods running for a particular deployment or replication controller.
```
$ kubectl scale --replicas=3 deployment http
```
Listing all the pods, you should see three running for the http deployment kubectl get pods

Once each Pod starts it will be added to the load balancer service. By describing the service you can view the endpoint and the associated Pods which are included.
```
$ kubectl describe svc http
```
Making requests to the service will request in different nodes processing the request.
```
$ curl http://172.17.0.19:8000
```
