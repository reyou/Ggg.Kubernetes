The run command creates a deployment based on the parameters specified, such as the image or replicas. This deployment is issued to the Kubernetes master which launches the Pods and containers required. Kubectl run_ is similar to docker run but at a cluster level.

The format of the command is kubectl run <name of deployment> <properties>

Task
The following command will launch a deployment called http which will start a container based on the Docker Image katacoda/docker-http-server:latest.
```
$ kubectl run http --image=katacoda/docker-http-server:latest --replicas=1
```
You can then use kubectl to view the status of the deployments
```
$ kubectl get deployments
```
To find out what Kubernetes created you can describe the deployment process.

kubectl describe deployment http

The description includes how many replicas are available, labels specified and the events associated with the deployment. These events will highlight any problems and errors that might have occurred.

In the next step we'll expose the running service.
