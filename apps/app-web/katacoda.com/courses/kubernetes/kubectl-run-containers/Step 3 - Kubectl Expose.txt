Step 3 - Kubectl Expose
With the deployment created, we can use kubectl to create a service which exposes the Pods on a particular port.

Expose the newly deployed http deployment via kubectl expose. The command allows you to define the different parameters of the service and how to expose the deployment.

Task
Use the following command to expose the container port 80 on the host 8000 binding to the external-ip of the host.

```
$ kubectl expose deployment http --external-ip="172.17.0.19" --port=8000 --target-port=80
```

You will then be able to ping the host and see the result from the HTTP service.

```
$ curl http://172.17.0.19:8000
```
