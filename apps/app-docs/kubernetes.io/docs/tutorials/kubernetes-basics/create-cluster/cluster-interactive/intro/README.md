We already installed minikube for you. 
Check that it is properly installed, 
by running the minikube version command:

$ minikube version

Start the cluster, by running the minikube start command:

$ minikube start

To check if kubectl is installed you can run the kubectl version command:

$ kubectl version

Let’s view the cluster details. We’ll do that by running kubectl cluster-info:

$ kubectl cluster-info

To view the nodes in the cluster, run the kubectl get nodes command:
